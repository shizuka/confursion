# Jane Doe

## Bio

Jane Doe is a sika deer who works as a journalist for the commune. She has golden brown fur, dark brown eyes, and three points on each antler. Her hair is down over her shoulders and occasionally tied back in a messy bun. Like all members of her species, despite being an adult she has retained fawn-like spots.

Before she transformed, Jane was a mixed race [Japanese-American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Americans) trans woman working an office job. After her transformation, she took up journalism to help the stories of anthros like herself be shared. She was already an activist, becoming an *anthro* activist was just another piece of the pie now.

Jane is [Deaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_culture) and knows four languages; English, Japanese, [American Sign Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language) and [Japanese Sign Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Sign_Language). She is able to hear some things but greatly prefers the use of sign language or writing to communicate.

Her anthro articles are also translated by her into Japanese, and she encourages others to translate them into languages she doesn't know. She is a huge proponent of accessability, both in general and to education.
