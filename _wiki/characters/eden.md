## Biography
Eden is a human of reasonable height, fair skin, and kindhearted countenance. He is never seen without a baseball cap, various gloves, and a surgical mask which he presumes will protect him from a hypothetical future wave of the [Antropomorphic Shift] (/anthropomorphic-shift) . His constant use of gloves and surgical mask is a result of supersition seeded by his fearful parants, which he to this day lives with.

Despite being fearful of the [Antropomorphic Shift] (/anthropomorphic-shift) , Eden has no qualms with the people affected by the event, warming up to them more so than his parents. Eden's lack of aversion, universal friendliness, and above average energy levels make him come off as immature, and in some cases disingeuous or manipulative. Although this is the case, he still remains polite, even when under stress or inquiry.

Within days of the first infection, Eden's parents forbade him from leaving their house for fear of corruption by the anthros. This, in combination with cabin feaver caused Eden to brainstorm on methods of protecting himself from the virus, and thus began his fixation on wearing surgical masks and gloves. His first venture into the public was nineteen days after the first infection, wherein Eden went to a store, then promptly visited a clinic to be tested for an anthropomorphic shift. To his contentment, the results turned up negative.

As time went on, Eden slowly began going out more often. As he left the comfort of his home and paranoid parents, he began to think for his own about the quality of life of the anthros, and who was looking out for them as he did for his parents. this way of thinking, and rumors of an anthro-led community caused Eden to chase the ilusive rumor, wanting to establish communication and trade with this community.
