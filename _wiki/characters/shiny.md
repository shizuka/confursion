## Biography

Shiny is a calico tomcat with green eyes, a white muzzle, and a white tail tip.

While attending a furry convention in Seattle with his boyfriend, The Shift started. He woke up in their hotel room to discover the bump he had been picking at on the base of his spine had sprouted into a full-fledged fluffy cat tail. Not exactly the type of thing you can hide for too long. He was absolutely delighted to transform, however as one of the (un)lucky few to be transformed early on the public reaction was not as warm.  

As well as growing crops and keeping chickens, plus creating art, Shiny runs Pawsitively Everything with his partner.
