## Biography

**Shiny** is a calico tomcat with [blue/green heterochromia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromia_iridum), a white muzzle, and a white tail tip. 

While attending a furry convention in Seattle with his boyfriend, he woke up in their hotel room to discover the bump he had been picking at on the base of his spine had sprouted into a full-fledged fluffy cat tail. The beginning of his anthropic shift wasn't exactly the type of thing you could hide for too long. He was absolutely delighted to transform, however as one of the (un)lucky few to be transformed early on the public reaction was not as warm.  

Along with farming and creating his art, Shiny runs Pawsitively Everything with [his partner]().
