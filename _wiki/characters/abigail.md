# Abigail

## Bio
Abigail is a tough, no-nonsense gal from Texas. She is an anthro cow with brown and white fur and blonde hair. She met Jane when she brought her child to the commune hoping for a better life. They became fast friends, and then became something more.

When she isn't working, or working out, she's often found strumming a tune.
