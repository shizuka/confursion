# Abigail

## Bio
Abigail is a tough, no-nonsense gal from Texas. She is an anthro cow with brown and white fur and blonde hair. She met Jane when she helped bring Abigail and her child to the commune for a better life. They became fast friends, and then became something more. Abigail learned ASL to more easily communicate with her girlfriend, and she knows a passable level of Spanish as well.

When she isn't working, or working out, she's often found strumming a tune on her guitar. Not an easy feat with hooves, but she manages.
