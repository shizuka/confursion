# Hoptimism Inn

The **Hoptimism Inn**, or occasionally *Hop Inn*, is a public house in the
village center of [Furhaven](/locations/furhaven), founded in 1 AF by [Shizuka
Valenheart](/characters/shizuka) and [Marina Hasenkamp](/characters/marina).
Originally conceived as an anthro-only establishment, plans for Hoptimism
quickly expanded to include a more coffeehouse setting and a small inn space for
anthros seeking shelter.
